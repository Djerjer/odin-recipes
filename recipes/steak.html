        <h2 class="ingr">Ingredients:</h2>

                <li>Peppercorn</li>
                <li>Fresh garlic and/or garlic powder</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Butter</li>

                <li>Thyme</li>
                <li>Cooking oil</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steak Temps:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extra Rare/Blue: <strong>115F-120F</strong></li>
                    <li>Rare: <strong>125F-130F</strong></li>
                    <li>Medium-Rare: <strong>130F-140F</strong></li>
                    <li>Medium: <strong>140F-150F</strong></li>
                    <li>Medium-Well: <strong>150F-155F</strong></li>
                    <li>Well-Done: <strong>160F+</strong></li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Season up the steak.</li>
                <li>Add your cooking oil into your choice of pan (<strong>Medium-high heat</strong>).</li>
                <li>Place steak into the pan after the pan has heated up.</li>
                <li>Cook the steak on each side for about 2 minutes to create a nice crust (<strong>Very important step.</strong> When it comes to cooking meat, a lot of flavor comes from creating a nice crust on the outside).</li>
                <li>After each side has been cooked to your liking, go ahead and add in your butter (at this point, you may turn the heat down a bit).</li>
                <li>Add in your sprigs of thyme, rosemary, and whole garlic(s) (you're going to be basting the steak until the inside is about <strong>145F</strong> for the inside to be medium-rare).</li>
                <li>Take the steak off the pan and have it rest on a cutting board for about 10 minutes (the steak will actually continue to slightly cook once it's freshly off of the pan).</li>
            </ol>
